        So I got a chance to have the best experience one can have in their high
        school, attending a 6 week long Summer program named PROMYS. Since a
        very young age, I always enjoyed solving math problems which were not
        very common in schools... so, when somehow, surfing through the internet
        trying to find such problems, I came across the problem set (P-set) for
        the PROMYS application. I was very fascinated, it was the perfect food
        for my mind for the next few weeks. This was the time when all the kids
        my age were preparing for “the board exams of class 10th” and I, was
        trying to find different approaches to the problems on the P-set. Weeks
        went by, I submitted the application, gave my board exams and finally
        was the time of the results of the applications, which was not specified
        when they would be out. So one evening I screamed out of nowhere, “I got
        in!!!”. That was when I knew my life has taken a new turn. Soon me and
        my family found ourselves on the beautiful campus of IISC Bangalore. I
        had always heard about it being the best for research students and I was
        very excited to finally be able to feel all that. We reached to check
        out the hostel which would be my home for the next few weeks. That is
        where I first met a few others who were also a part of PROMYS. Little
        did I know that they would be my family and we would make memories
        together that would stay with us lifelong. I met my counselor who would
        be helping and guiding me throughout my time there (but would never ever
        tell the solution to any problem, rather, counter question me which
        would leave me more confused) That was a long day. The classes began the
        next day, and professor Ila Verma got us familiar with all the basics of
        number theory we would be requiring. A week later an advanced lecture
        was beginning for the returning students, which was Projective geometry.
        I was really fascinated by its concept. So I decided to take that
        lecture as well, which probably was the best decision I had taken
        because it opened a new world for me. Our Professor
